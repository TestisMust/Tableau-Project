**US Pollution Statistics
**Air pollutants are suspected to cause respiratory health issues. XYZ Ltd. is a global community that works to create awareness to reduce air pollution. The company collects and publishes air pollution data with the help of experts to analyze the data.
The health ministry of the US approached the community to seek help in developing new air pollution reduction strategies.
Jasen, a data analyst at XYZ Ltd., needs to analyze and visualize the various columns of the data published in the reports. Help Jasen perform the data analysis by accomplishing the tasks. Note: All the charts need to have appropriate chart titles.

Characteristics of pollution dataset:
The dataset contains the details of US pollution data. We will be using only the following columns/fields:
Fields/Columns	Description
State	Names of the states
City	Names of the cities
NO2 Mean	Average quantity of Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) pollutant in ppb (parts per billion) unit
O3 Mean	Average quantity of Ozone (O3) pollutant in ppb (parts per billion) unit
SO2 Mean	Average quantity of Sulphur Dioxide (SO2) pollutant in ppb (parts per billion) unit
CO Mean	Average quantity of Carbon Monoxide (CO) pollutant in ppb
(parts per billion) unit
NO2 AQI	-	Air quality index for Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2)	
O3 AQI - Air quality index for Ozone (O3)	
SO2 AQI	-	Air quality index for Sulphur Dioxide (SO2)	
CO AQI - Air quality index for Carbon Monoxide (CO)	
Date Local		Dates of data capture	

Tasks to Perform
Task 1
1.	Display the state-wise average of each of the following for January 2010:
a)	CO Mean
b)	O3 Mean
c)	NO2 Mean
2.	Repeat the above task for February 2010 and March 2010.
3.	Write down the names of the top three states where NO2 pollution is consistently high for three consecutive months.
 
Task 2
Display the top 10 polluted cities (based on average NO2) and their corresponding states based on the averages of each of the following:
a)	CO Mean
b)	NO2 Mean
c)	O3 Mean
d)	SO2 Mean
Which state has the highest number of the most polluted cities?
Expected Output
 
Task 3
California is one of the most preferred states for people to settle down in. Display city-wise average Air Quality Index (AQI) for each of the following for the state of California (for all the dates).
a)	CO AQI
b)	NO2 AQI
c)	O3 AQI
d)	SO2 AQI
Identify and write down the top two cities with the highest pollution.
Expected Output
 
Task 4
For the two cities identified in Task 3, display the averages of each of the following (for all the dates):
a)	CO Mean
b)	NO2 Mean
c)	O3 Mean
d)	SO2 Mean
Write down the name of the pollutant whose measure is consistently high for each city.
 
Task 5
Display year-wise (2000-2010) variation of the average AQI for each of the following for the states of California and New Jersey separately.
a)	CO Mean
b)	NO2 Mean
c)	O3 Mean
d)	SO2 Mean
 
Task 6
Vehicular pollution accounts for the majority of NO2 and CO in the air. The state governments of
California and New Jersey implemented a few changes in the emission norms of vehicles in the year 2000. Analyze if there is any drop in the levels of NO2 and CO in Los Angeles city and Newark city between the years 2001 and 2003.
